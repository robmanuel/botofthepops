  >> This week: Pop Adverts <<
  Pop songs and singers are always being signed up
  for adverts, but there are loads of
  opportunities that have been missed. Where's
  Sinitta's "So Paxo", John Lydon's "Anchory in
  the UK" or George Michael's "Careless Wispa"?
  Combine songs and products in ways that make us
  laugh and which inevitably become real when the
  ad agencies read this.
