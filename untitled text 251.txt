This video is going to be very boring.
Nothing is going to happen in this video.
140 seconds of pure boringness
* timer starts  in corner of the screen*
No, that's not right we've already used X seconds
* timer spins to correct number  in corner of the screen*
Nothing exciting is going to happen in this one 
like a photograph of a cute kitten
Or
Some fascinating fact about the minutiae of how pencil sharpeners work
Really 
We mean it
NOTHING is going to happen
We're not going to accidentally make it interesting...
by making the video blue
*make screen blue*
ok we lied about that
* back to white *
Sorry about the excitement
Has your patience been tested yet?
Make we could liven things up by changing the font?
This one is bold
This is italics
And this is how people did smiley faces before emoji 
:)
Happy isn't she?
How much time have we got left?
I suppose we could look in the corner of the screen
Hmm.... What's that bit of dirt just there?
*turns out there's a single pixel been black the whole way through the video - a circle is drawn around it to draw eye*
You should wipe your screen you know
We could liven this video up by pretending it's a fly
and making it buzz about
but we won't
Anyway... 
We would have liked to make this video longer
And really bored the pants off you
But 140 seconds is the max length of video on Twitter 
So just time for the advert bit
Sorry
The boring book. A surprisingly non-boring book for non-boring people.
