As a group of middle-aged white men, we feel duty-bound to tell you about our podcast. It’s at btlpodcast.com - and you and your rather nerdish readers might like it as it’s the complete podcast compendium to the htichhikers Guide to the Galaxy. And we’re covering the radio, TV, book and film incarnations of Douglas Adams' "trilogy in five parts" (plus one), alphabetically, from Arthur to Zaphod and all points in-between.

Lots of love 

Jon, Jon, Danny and Mark
